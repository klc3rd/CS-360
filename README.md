The requirements for this project was to create a weight tracking app. There was to be user registration and logging in. There was also to be the ability to add and edit weights. We were to have a way to change the goal. After the goal is reached, it is to send an SMS notification according to the phone number set in the settings.

My design is successful because it is very straight forward. There is a login and registration page. There is a single main page that everything is built around. There is also a settings page, and a page for editing a weight entry. The success comes from basic simplicity. It is a very straightforward and easy to use interface.

Our app was created using an iterative approach. This is much like you would see on an Agile team. We first created basic components of the design in an MVC architecture. The final stages of the development was implementing the business logic. In this repository there is a zipped copy of the basic design files.

The code was ensured to be functional with basic usage testing. I went through and tested different scenarios. If we had more time, I would have implemented unit and systems testing. This current project, however, is simple enough that basic manual testing seemed sufficient.

While the reading material was quite good, and I had some difficulties, there were a few items that I needed to continue to research. Some of the material glossed over some areas fairly quickly. For example, using SQLite and creating a recycler view. These two items I had to do a decent amount of research in order to get working, however I did.

The part of the program I am most proud of was creating the logic to interact with the database. This is an area I felt very little confidence in but after a little bit of reading, had no issue quickly setting up. I also isolated the code to promote high cohesion and low coupling. The database files could easily be introduced into another application.
